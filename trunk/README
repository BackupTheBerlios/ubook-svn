Hi!

	/* Requirements */
This is uBook. To run it on a server you need
 - a webserver with PHP support (Apache)
 - PHP4 or higher with MySQL support (perhaps you have to activate it
   during compiling)
 - MySQL5 or higher (for MySQL4 you need to rewrite some SQL
   statements in the uBook code)
 
	/* Install / Config */
 - Place this directory with all files in some webspace. Don't forget
   the hidden files .htaccess and .htusers. The .htaccess file will 
   protect the admin scripts.
 - Configure these two files.
 - Now uBook needs MySQL access. Create a user in the database (e.g.
   phpMyAdmin).
 - The username, password and database has to be stored in a file
   named 'mysql.php'. The best way to do this is to give the 
   webserver write access to this directory for a short time 
   (chmod 777 ./). Then you call admin_setup.php through your 
   webbrowser and let this script write the config file.
 - After this you should change the rights for others (chmod 755 ./).
 - Now we have a mysql.php file, which is owned by the server and
   nobody else can read or write it.
 - Installation complete.
 - You should create some categories for the books on
   admin_categories.php and write some information about the 
   responsible person in about.php.

	/* Create something new */
Perhaps you want to change some html code or play with the style 
sheets. Feel free to write me an E-Mail (ubook@asta-bielefeld.de) and
report about problems, experience and further developement. But you 
have to keep the license, which can be found in the file COPYING.
uBook is free software.
