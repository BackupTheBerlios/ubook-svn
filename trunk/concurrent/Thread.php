/**
 * Represents a thread running concurrent to other threads.
 *
 * PHP doesn't support threads
 * ({@link http://php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-fork.php exception}). In most
 * cases threads are no good idea. But they can be useful while working with
 * external resources like network connections.
 *
 * All your threads will run on one CPU. These are virtual threads.
 *
 * You can directly download the source code at BerliOS:
 * - {@link http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/ubook/branches/concurrent/}
 *
 * <b>How To Use</b>
 *
 * Create two threads and let them run concurrently:
 * <code>
 *  class NetworkThread extends Thread {
 *
 *      private $handle;
 *      private $response = '';
 *
 *      public function __construct($host) {
 *          parent::__construct(); // This call is important!
 *          $this->handle = fsockopen($host, 80);
 *          stream_set_blocking($this->handle, 0);
 *          fputs($this->handle, "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n");
 *      }
 *
 *      public function step() {
 *          $this->response .= fread($this->handle, 1024);
 *      }
 *
 *      public function isFinished() {
 *          return feof($this->handle);
 *      }
 *
 *      public function getResponse() {
 *          return $this->response;
 *      }
 *
 *  }
 *
 *  $thread1 = new NetworkThread('ubook.berlios.de');
 *  $thread2 = new NetworkThread('ubook.asta-bielefeld.de');
 *
 *  Thread::joinAll();
 *
 *  // The responses begin with 'HTTP'.
 *  echo substr($thread1->getResponse(), 0, 4); /// HTTP
 *  echo substr($thread2->getResponse(), 0, 4); /// HTTP
 * </code>
